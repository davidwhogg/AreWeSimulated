It is revealed that his memories have been altered before, erasing an entire previous life as a martian agent, then replaced by the identity he is familiar with. However, this is contradicted by the possibility that this exciting previous life and all issues surrounding it may not have occurred at all, but rather been the product of the initial implementation of memories he requested. If such was the case, the construction worker would be living in a simulated dream custom formulated by the corporation to reproduce the life he desired to experience and would be forced into waking up once his request was satisfied.}

The user's conscious must be ``uploaded'', thus allowing them to possess the body of an identical alter ego, which already independently exists within the simulation. These alter ego's are fully-functional simulated humans who are not aware that they are programmed nor that their reality is not concrete. When a user is transported to the simulation, the simulated human loses consciousness and yields full control of the body and are left with no recollection of events experienced by the user. Users can only be within the simulation for a couple of hours, due to the physical limitations of the machine. Within the 1930's simulated world, a wire-frame model of the world signifying the physical boundary of the simulation is hidden in a remote location; the same phenomenon at a similar remote location is discovered in the 1999 world, revealing that the two worlds are nested simulations.}
