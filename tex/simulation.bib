These alter ego's are fully-functional simulated humans who are not aware that they are programmed nor that their reality is not concrete. When a user is transported to the simulation, the simulated human loses consciousness and yields full control of the body and are left with no recollection of events experienced by the user. Users can only be within the simulation for a couple of hours, due to the physical limitations of the machine. Within the 1930's simulated world, a wire-frame model of the world signifying the physical boundary of the simulation is hidden in a remote location; the same phenomenon at a similar remote location is discovered in the 1999 world, revealing that the two worlds are nested simulations.}
